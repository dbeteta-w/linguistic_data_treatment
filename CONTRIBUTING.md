# Contributing to Linguistic Data Treatment
Thanks for your interest in this project! The goal is to bring fast, reliable, and trouble-free open-source cleaning processes to all communities.
We love your input! We want to make every contribution to this project as transparent and effortless as possible.
Please note that we have a code of conduct that we need to follow moving forward in all your interactions with the project.

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs.

*Great Bug Reports* tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
You can check the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for more information about a good coding style. It's important to respect and follow it up to keep good practices. If it's difficult for you please, take in consideration use `flake8`.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
